The dataset is about red blood cells present in humans with respect to their age 
Now rbc values have to be predicted on the basis of their age
Independent varables are fitted with polynomial features by importing required libraries and functions

Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis in machine learning where the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable is modeled as an nth-degree polynomial. It extends the concept of linear regression by allowing for more complex relationships between the variables.

In linear regression, the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable is assumed to be linear. However, in many real-world scenarios, the relationship may not be linear, and a polynomial regression model can capture these nonlinear relationships more accurately.

The polynomial regression model can be represented as:

y = β0 + β1 * x + β2 * x^2 + β3 * x^3 + ... + βn * x^n + ε

where:

y is the dependent variable
x is the independent variable
β0, β1, β2, ..., βn are the coefficients of the polynomial terms
ε is the error term
